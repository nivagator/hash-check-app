# HASH Check App
Project I started to practice the practical application of Python.

App will accept a local file path and an optional HASH string. After selecting
a HASH library, the app will compare the provided HASH string with the hashed file
and alert the user if it matches or not. If the HASH string is left blank, the app
will generate the hash of the file using the selected hash library.
